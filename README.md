<!-- [REPLACEME: badges, remove if you don't show any badges] -->

The Digital Automatic Couple Migration Decision Support System (short DAC Migration DSS) helps to set up the plan for switching from screw couplers to digital automatic couplers.

Within the next years it is forseen to retrofit around 500 K vehicles from the old coupler type to the new ones. This will affect rail undertakings, wagon owners, workshops and many others in the
rail industry all over Europe. This crucial as well as unparalleld undertaking calls for a software finally supporting all stages of migration. For now following the steps of the planing proces the
startegic planing is focussed.
